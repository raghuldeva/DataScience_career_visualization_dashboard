CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.\n",

The ability to transform a sea of data into actionable insights can have a profound impact—for predicting the best new diabetes treatment to identifying and thwarting national security threats. That’s why businesses and government agencies are rushing to hire data science professionals who can help do just that. The first step toward establishing an active data analytics platform is to collect structured and unstructured data from different sources. Unstructured data consists of things like what customers are saying about the organization on social media, while structured data is a measurable metric, such as customer lifetime value.\n",

Jai Kisan today provides digital financial services starting with credit for online and offline, income generating, rural commerce transactions. THE PROBLEM WE ARE SOLVING: Informal credit by the merchant or seller is an expectation for customers and not a value-added service in rural India. Lack of formalized credit poses a dire and imperative challenge for rural businesses to grow. WHAT WE DO: Jai Kisan has leveraged the captive relationship between the business and the farmer and rural individuals in a B2B2C manner to deploy credit to farmers and rural individuals en masse in a sustainable manner working with 700+ organized and unorganized entities in the space with a cumulative customer base of over 1.5 lakh rural individuals including farmers. By empowering rural businesses through point-of-sale/purchase credit, Jai-Kisan has helped create scalability for rural businesses and helps deploy low-cost formal credit to farmers and other rural individuals. OUR INVESTORS: Jai Kisan has raised US $30mn in Series A funding led by Mirae Asset with participation from Syngenta Group Ventures, existing investors and others, prior to this, Jai Kisan had raised US$ 4mn in a pre-Series A funding round led by Arkam Ventures. Also joining in the round was NABVENTURES — the VC arm of Indian development finance institution (DFI), the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) in its first-ever private investment. WHO WORKS AT JAI KISAN: The Jai Kisan team is dedicated towards executing our mission and is passionate towards supporting the transformation of rural India. An entrepreneurial attitude and passion to drive results are core values we seek in every member of our team. Our team comes with varied industry experiences from experienced product builders to industries such as private equity, management consultancy and much more. We pride ourselves on having a dedicated professional team focused on building world class solutions to deliver sustainable financing to rural India.\n",

I found that the work-life balance got in the way of progress. It's one thing to come in late (~10) but everyone left around 4 and took at least an hour for lunch. Progress was slow and then at deadlines, pressure from the planning team led to cutting corners. In addition, they claimed they would invest in their new hires through mentorship and experience with cutting-edge tech, but I found that people did not have the time or interest to mentor others and it was discouraged to learn anything technical outside of individual job focus.\n"

Just as a galvanic anode is a piece of dissimilar metal tacked onto the metallic structure of a building or a boat's hull, to protect the structure from corrosion, by attracting the corrosion to this anode, these openings are there for the purpose of attracting the next round of layoffs.  Protecting the long-time-there, job veterans, that is.  2 people in that latter slot have now been laid off, while the others (senior ranking engineers), always stay.

      "ETD group in Houston has openings 1317005 and 1286505, which I would avoid like the plague.  1286505 especially is what I would call a \"galvanic anode\" opening.  Just as a galvanic anode is a piece of dissimilar metal tacked onto the metallic structure of a building or a boat's hull, to protect the structure from corrosion, by attracting the corrosion to this anode, these openings are there for the purpose of attracting the next round of layoffs.  Protecting the long-time-there, job veterans, that is.  2 people in that latter slot have now been laid off, while the others (senior ranking engineers), always stay.  The senior ranking engineers will keep it that way, by whatever methods they can get away with.  The office politics there is the 2nd worst I have ever seen in more than 30 years in the EE business.\n",

      "I've only been working at TWC for one week, so I'm still in training. This company is not perfect but I've been thoroughly impressed by the blatant intent to ensure employee value, direction of company and reasons to stay. The interview, HR intake and training have all been great. The training is a bit informal and unstructured but I seriously do not have much issue with it, as I come from a 'sink or swim' environment. Diane you are doing a great job! So, Diane is a manager over the APS group in Charlotte, NC, doing some pre-training. I like her spunk and willingness to improve processes. Managers don't micromanage. A good sign as it does not work with IT people, who by nature have to be self-sufficient. I like the calm atmosphere here, A LOT.\n",

      "\n",
      "I may be a noob, but not a noob to life. I like it here. For those who feel there is no room to grow, invest in your education and apply for a different position. TWC prefers to promote and hire internally. Any downfalls TWC may have, I can resolve by investing in myself. TWC has placed many paths to grow in man and retire with the company. The opportunities are there, but you do have to reach for them. Like life do not expect anything good to fall into your lap. Get out there and hustle.\n",

Stats are more important than BSA/AML Compliance regulations (agents are expected to work cases quickly and, if a case is taking too long, agents are told to \"cut it off\" instead of completing a thorough investigation). Stats are more important then the employee (i.e., even if the city is shut down due to a major snow day, employees are expected to be at work and may even be \"written up\" if they do not show up that day due to the weather). \n",

Instead, they will have meetings where employees are told that management \"may have to fire the majority of the department\" if the stats aren't met. Tenured phone agents are held to stats of people in different (easier) segments to \"challenge\" them, then when they are unable to meet those stats, they are denied a bonus because they \"didn't meet the requirements of their peers\". \n",
